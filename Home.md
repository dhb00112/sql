Hello There!.

   I would like to use this repository to talk about the Teamcenter datamodel in general. 
We would see how the basic connections between objects work in Teamcenter and device SQLs to navigate the Teamcenter datamode.

**Caution:** Teamcenter database exploring is quite rewarding. The time it takes to execute complex queries and return results is the fastest in this mode. All other ways of doing so, say, an ITK executable to pull up needed information or a Teamcenter Query Builder query would not be straightforward and would definitely be slow!. And so this mode has to be used with utmost diligence. I advice you to use a READ-ONLY privileged account and not the infodba account to prevent accidental mis-use or updates to the database.
