   What we are seeing below is a sample Teamcenter BMIDE class diagram excerpt without any attributes listed. Lets deep dive into these classes / tables to understand more.

   `POM_Object` At the top of the Teamcenter class ( database table ) hierarchy lies this table. This is the core class of Teamcenter around with other database tables take life. And as such it holds some crucial and minimal information within itself that every single Teamcenter object should have. These are the `Owning site` and `timestamp` properties. Also a `puid` column is also available for the table. This puid is the unique identifier for a given Teamcenter object. There are complex C++ classes and C structures ( called Data Managers ) that are involved in generating a puid based on the object type and the time it gets created for a given site. Note that the corresponding database table name is `pPOM_Object`. The usual notation is to have a prefix character 'p' beside the BMIDE class name for the corresponding table.

   `POM_Application_Object` We have seen that POM_Object stores the site information of an object in Teamcenter. If we take an object like an Item or a dataset, our natural question would be to understand how the metadata like Owning user or creation timestamp gets saved. Well, this is where POM_Application_Object comes into picture. This table contains information like the Owning user, creation date, Last Modification User and Last Modified Date. The corresponding database table is `pPOM_Application_Object`.

   `WorkspaceObject `This one is easy. Every single object that a user is supposed to interact with is supposed to be a ( subclass of ) Workspace Object. Item, Dataset, BOMView, RevisionRule etc are some of the examples. This table hosts information about the object name, the object description and the object type ( just the string ) to name a few. The corresponding table is `pWorkspaceObject`.

   `Item`, `ItemRevision`, `Dataset` etc are the tables that hold more specializations of workspaceobject and are stored in `pItem`, `pItemRevision` and `pDataset` table respectively.

   Now lets explore more about the ones that we did not mention. For instance, `PSOccurrence` ( database table `pPSOccurrence`) and `ImanRelation` ( database table `pImanRelation` ). If you think about it, neither of them are directly visible to the end user. The content of a BOM in Teamcenter's Structure Manager application or Manufacturing Product Planner applications are actually made up of BOMLines - runtime constructs that get created by pulling information from say, Item, Item Revision, PSOccurrence etc. Since the user does not really work with them, they are not placed below the WorkspaceObject class in Teamcenter. Instead, they are just specializations of POM_Object. Next one is relation. The GRM relation is just a third container to tie up two different objects - the primary and the secondary. So if you have a dataset attached as a specification, then you really do not see the relationship itself in the UI. This too is because GRM Relationships too are directly under POM_Objects and not under WorkspaceObjects.
